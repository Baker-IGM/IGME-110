Once you've reviewed those materials, go to myCourses and take the [Information Evaluation survey](https://mycourses.rit.edu/d2l/lms/survey/admin/modify/survey_newedit_properties.d2l?si=764021&ou=658493). (Note: This survey will not be available until 8:10am on Tuesday, September 5th.)

After everyone has completed the survey, we'll discuss the results in class.

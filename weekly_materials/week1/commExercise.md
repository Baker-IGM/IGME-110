# Week 1 Thursday Exercise: Google Drive and Slack Collaboration

1. Log into RIT's Google Apps site (http://google.rit.edu), go to the Drive section, and select the "Shared With Me" option in the left sidebar. You should see a folder for your group (e.g. "IGME.110.2017 Group X"). If you don't see it, let Professor Lawley or Emily know that there's a problem. 

2. Right-click the group folder, and from the drop-down menu choose "Add to My Drive" <br>![Add to Drive Screenshot](add2drive.png). (You may also want to "Star" the folder to make it easier to find, since Google Drive can be confusing to navigate.)

3. Open the Week 01 Notes document inside the folder, and add some notes from this week's lectures. If other members of your group have already entered notes, you don't need to replicate them--instead, you can add to them, edit them, format them, etc. There doesn't need to be a lot of content, but when we look at the version history for the file (File->Version History->See version history), we should see some evidence of meaningful partcipation by you. 

4. In a different browser tab, open the class Slack site at http://lawley-110-2017.slack.com/

5. Find your group's private channel; it should show up in the channel list on the left side, or you can look through the list of all channels in the team by clicking on the "Channels" title in the sidebar. If you don't see a private channel with your group's number, it's because we couldn't find you on Slack when we set them up early Thursday morning; ask Professor Lawley or Emily to add you now.

6. Using [these instructions on the Slack website](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205875058-Google-Drive-for-Slack), add Google Drive access to your Slack account. (Don't worry...when you give Slack access to your Drive files, that access is for you only and not for everyone in the Slack team!). Once it's been set up, share the Week 1 Notes document from your Google Drive notes folder to your group's private channel.

7. Configure you Slack notifications. You can change the overall settings for the Slack, and then you can override the global settings on a channel-by-channel basis. What I generally do is turn on all notifications for the class, and then mute individual channels, like #github-updates, #introductions, and #random. You're welcome to set it up in whatever way works best for you. (However, since the #announcements channel is used only by the professor and TA for class-wide announcements, it's probably a bad idea to mute that channel!)

***If you have an iOS or Android mobile device, I highly recommend installing the Slack app so that you don't have to be in front of a computer to get notifications!***

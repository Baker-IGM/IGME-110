# Week 1 Tuesday Homework: Communication Basics

In this exercise, you'll set up your Slack account and send me your username so that I can add you to a private  channel for your notetaking group.  All tasks must be completed by midnight on Tuesday, 8/29. 

***Important note:*** *If you already use Slack with another group, you will not be able to use that login for the class Slack. Every Slack team is a separate system, with its own usernames and passwords. You can, however, be logged into multiple Slack teams from the same client.*

1. Create an account in our class Slack at http://lawley-110-2017.slack.com. (You will have to use your RIT email for this.) [Edit your profile](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile) to include your first and last name, and a (recognizable) photo of yourself. 

2. In myCourses, modify your profile page to include the same photo you used on your Slack profile. 

3. Use your RIT email account to send a message to me (Elizabeth.Lawley@rit.edu). The email should have the subject line "110 Introduction – Your Name”. At a minimum, the email should tell me what your username is in Slack; you're welcome to provide more of an introduction if you'd like (I always enjoy learning more about my students), but that won't affect your grade.

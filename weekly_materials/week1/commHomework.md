# Week 1 Tuesday Homework: Communication Basics

In this exercise, you'll set up your Slack account and send me your username so that I can add you to a private channel for your notetaking group.  You'll also add a photo to your myCourses profile. All tasks should be completed before 8am on Wednesday, 8/30, so that we can add you to the correct private channel in Slack. 

***Important note:*** *If you already use Slack with another group, you will not be able to use that login for the class Slack. Every Slack team has its own unique usernames and passwords. You can, however, be logged into multiple Slack teams from the same client.*

1. Create an account in our class Slack at http://lawley-110-2017.slack.com. (You will have to use your RIT email for this.) [Edit your profile](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile) to include your first and last name, and a (recognizable) photo of yourself. 

2. In myCourses, modify your profile page to include the same photo you used on your Slack profile. 

3. Use your RIT email account to send a message to me (Elizabeth.Lawley@rit.edu). The email should have the subject line "110 Introduction – Your Name”. At a minimum, the email should tell me what your username is in Slack; you're welcome to provide more of an introduction if you'd like (I always enjoy learning more about my students), but that won't affect your grade.

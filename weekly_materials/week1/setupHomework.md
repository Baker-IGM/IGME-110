# Week 1 Tuesday Homework: Communication Basics

Before starting this week's homework, make sure you've done the [readings for Thursday's class](../../Schedule.md#w1-th-readings).

All tasks must be completed before the start of class on Thursday. 

1. Use your RIT email account to send a message to me (Elizabeth.Lawley@rit.edu). The email should have the subject line "110 Introduction – Your Name”. The content of the email is up to you. You'll get the same amount of credit with a blank message as you will with a lengthy and detailed introduction telling me about yourself. 
2. After reading the Slack tutorials, add yourself to the class Slack at http://lawley-110-2017.slack.com. (You will have to use your RIT email for this.) Your username should be your name, in the form FirstLast, FirstL, or FLast (e.g. LizLawley or LizL or LLawley). Add a (recognizable) photo to your Slack profile
3. In myCourses, modify your profile page to include the same photo you used on your Slack profile.

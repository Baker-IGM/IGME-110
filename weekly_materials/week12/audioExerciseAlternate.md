# Alternate Digital Audio Exercise

This exercise introduces you to the process of adding captions or subtitles to a video.  

You will need to produce captions for an ~80-second video generated from a five-slide PowerPoint presentation--16 seconds of narration for each of 5 slides.  


## Creating the Files

1. Download and decompress the [archive of sample presentations](sample-ignites.zip).  
- Each presentation has 6 slides: An intro/title slide, 4 presentation slides, and a credits slide at the end. 
- Choose the set of slides you want to work with.  You can choose from Chocolate, Dr. Who, Star Wars or Nintendo. Don't worry too much about the content of the narration--this is about process rather than content, so your content doesn't even have to be accurate! (Yes, if you absolutely must, you can change the slides and use a different topic. But remember the goal of this exercise is learning to create captions/subtitles, so spending a lot of time on content production isn't necessary or wise.)

2. In a plain text file, write a script to accompany the presentation. 
The narration for each slide should fit in a reasonable way within the time constraints (15 seconds per slide). 

3. Use the Save As... option in Powerpoint to save your presentation as an .mp4 video.

## Submitting your files
Submit your finished .pptx file to the Week 12 Exercise: Ignite Soundtrack dropbox. If you choose to work on this on your own rather than coming to class on Thursday, the completed presentation, with working audio, must be submitted to the myCourses dropbox by the beginning of Thursday's class. If you come to class on Thursday, the exercise is due by 6pm on Saturday, November 18th.

# Poster Project

In this assignment, you will design a marketing poster for a game, movie or show of your choice.

## Deliverables

There are several separate deliverables for this Project, because I want to make sure you don't wait to start it until the night before it's due!

### [Mood Board](../exercises/moodBoardExercise/moodBoardExercise): Due by {{ site.classStartTime }} on Tuesday, Febuary 18th

The first deliverable is for you to build a mood board that fully captures the tone and the aesthetics of the IP you chose. You will use the mood board as a visual reference and guide while designing the front and back of the box. Make sure you've done your research of the chosen IP so that your end product fits with the esablished look and feel of the IP.

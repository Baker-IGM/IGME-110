In this assignment, you will design a marketing poster for a game, movie or show of your choice.

## Deliverables

There are several separate deliverables for this Project, because I want to make sure you don't wait to start it until the night before it's due!

### [Mood Board](../exercises/moodBoardExercise/moodBoardExercise): Due by {{ site.classStartTime }} on Tuesday, Febuary 18th

The first deliverable is for you to build a mood board that fully captures the tone and the aesthetics of the IP you chose. You will use the mood board as a visual reference and guide while designing the front and back of the box. Make sure you've done your research of the chosen IP so that your end product fits with the esablished look and feel of the IP.

### First Draft of Poster: Due by {{ site.classStartTime }} on Tuesday, Febuary 25th

Using your mood moard create an initial design of your Poster. The goal of this Poster is to get the viewer interested in wanting the product shown. Make sure to include the title and any information relevate about uptaining the product(release date, platforms for games, special offers). Beyond that you are free to do whatever you think is best for your Poster.

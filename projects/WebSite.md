# Web Site

In this assignment, you will create a website in which you provide information about or related to the topic of your paper. It should not simply be a reworking of your paper, but rather a resource or reference site.  

The site must be uploaded to banjo.rit.edu by 6pm on Friday, October 28th. 

## Requirements
  - The main page must be located at http&#58;//people.rit.edu/~youruserid/igme110/2017project/
  - The main index.html page should include a title with the site topic and a relevant image, as well as your name and a photo of you. 
  - There should be a minimum of three pages linked from the main page: one with an overview of your paper topic, one with a full version of your paper (formatted appropriately for the web), and one with a web-friendly version of your bibliography (including links from each entry to the original source wherever possible). 
  - Each of the linked pages should have a link back to the main page, as well as links to the other content pages.
  - Each of the pages should include at least one appropriate image (a photograph, a logo, etc).
  - Credits for all images used on the site should be included on your sources page.
  - You may use templates and/or code libraries from other sources, provided that it is explicitly made available for re-use, and you explicitly list and attribute what you use on the sources page. 
  - All pages must properly validate for both HTML and CSS. We will use the validators at https&#58;//validator.w3.org/ and https&#58;//jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ to check this. 

I will provide example template files for all four of the required files, as well as a basic styles.css file. You are welcome to use these as a starting point, but if you do not modify the appearance of the site in any way other than to paste in your own content, the highest grade you can receive is a “C”. 

## Privacy
If you have concerns about privacy, I can provide you with a method to restrict access to the portfolio directory so that only RIT-affiliated users can view it. See me during my office hours for information on how to implement this option.

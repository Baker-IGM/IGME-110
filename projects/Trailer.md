# Trailer Project

Using Adobe Premiere (or your video editing software of choice), make a short trailer for some kind of media (game, tv show, movie, etc). You will be responsible for finding or providing the video that you will edit for this exercise. Feel free to cut between different videos, if it fits your trailer. You may use audio from the source video, replace the audio with other sound assets, or some combination of both.


# Requirements

Your video must meet the following requirements:
1.  Your submitted video must be between 1-2 minutes long.
2.  Your video must have at least 10 cuts (switches between shots).
3.  Your video must have at least 6 effects (with transitions counting as effects).


# Premiere Tips

Adding files to your project: To add files to your project, simply drag them directly onto the timeline. You can also use File>Import.

Saving your project: Save your project as you normally would (File>Save). This will create a .prproj file. You can reopen this .prproj file, but know that the prproj file does not save all of your source material (compared to .psd files in Photoshop which contain everything you are working with). This means that you cannot delete, move, or rename your source files once they have been imported. If you move or rename your file, you'll be able to locate your files again.

Opening your project: Sometimes when opening your project, your project timeline will be blank. Look for the saved version of your project timeline. It will look like this:

If you have other questions, feel free to ask me or look it up on the internet.


# Rendering your Video

BEFORE RENDERING: Save your project, and ensure that it is properly saved. Sometimes rendering can cause the program to crash and you might lose some or all of your work.

Once you have edited your video and saved your project, you will need to "render" it out to a single file that you can share. To do this, go to File>Export>Media. In the Export Settings window, set the format to "H.264". Once that is set, select the "YouTube 720p HD" preset from the dropdown. After you have set both of those correctly, press the "Export" button.

Exporting should take a few seconds. If it takes more than a minute, something is probably wrong or your video is too long. Let me know if it seems like the program has frozen.


# Submitting Your Work

You will need to submit three things to the dropbox for this assignment.
1.  A rendered version of your trailer (see above for details on rendering in Premiere).
2.  A screenshot of your project timeline in Premiere, to show that you actually did your own edits (see below for example).
3.  A text document explaining your intent / thought process in creating the video (3 sentences or less).

# Basic HTML Markup Exercise

## Overview & Goals

In today's exercise, you'll complete all of the  guides from the [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) module on the Mozilla Developers Network (MDN) site, and then complete the first assessment (the letter markup) at the end of the section.

I recommend _skimming_ the guides so that you get a general idea of the content being covered in each, and then referring back to them for detail as you work on the assessment.

Right-click on [this link](/letter-text.html) to download the HTML file you'll need to mark up for the assessment. (Make sure you give the file an `.html` extension!)

## Deliverables

Upload your completed HTML document to the myCourses Assignments dropbox by 3pm on Thursday.

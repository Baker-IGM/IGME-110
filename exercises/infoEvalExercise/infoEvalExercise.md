# Information Evaluation Exercise

Begin by reading these three brief articles on mandatory vs voluntary voting: [voting-articles.pdf](voting-articles.pdf)

Next, look at this tweet: https://twitter.com/MoveOn/status/666772893846675456?lang=en

Once you've reviewed those materials, go to myCourses and take the Information Evaluation survey (choose "Surveys" from the main menu bar). 

After everyone has completed the survey, we'll discuss the results in class before I lecture on the topic.

# Week 1 Tuesday Homework: Communication Basics

In this exercise, you'll set up your Slack account and send your username to the professor and the TA so that we can add you to a private channel for your notetaking group.  You'll also add a photo to your Slack profile. All tasks should be completed no later than 5pm on Wednesday, 8/29, so that we can add you to the correct private channel in Slack. 

***Important note:*** *If you already use Slack with another group, you will not be able to use that login for the class Slack. Every Slack team has its own unique usernames and passwords. You can, however, be logged into multiple Slack teams from the same client.*

1. Create an account in our class Slack at http://lawley-110-2018.slack.com. You will have to use your RIT email address for this. Your user name should include your first and last name. For example:   `ericbaker`, `eric_baker` `eric-baker`. [Edit your profile](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile) to include your first and last name, and a (recognizable) photo of yourself. 

2. Post a brief message to the "introductions" channel in Slack so that we know your account is working. (*Optional: Join the #memes channel by clicking on the word "Channels" in the left sidebar and selecting the channel. You can use that channel to post any memes you'd like to share.*)

3. Use your RIT email account (not a personal acccount!) to send a message to your professor (eabigm@rit.edu). Add a cc: for your TA,  (). The email should have the subject line "Your Name, 110 Fall 2018‚Äù. Use the guidelines provided in this week's reading when composing your message. At a minimum, the email should tell me what your username is in Slack. You're welcome to provide more of an introduction if you'd like (I always enjoy learning more about my students!), but that's not required and won't affect your grade.

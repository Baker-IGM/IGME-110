# Digital Video Editing Exercise

Using our video editing software of choice, make a short video that combines various video clips into one coherent story. You will be responsible for finding or providing the videos that you will be editing for this exercise. You may use audio from the source video, replace the audio with other sound assets, or some combination of both.

## Examples

-   [The Godfather](https://youtu.be/8Pf8BkFLBRw)

## Requirements

Your video must meet the following requirements:

-   Video must be atleast 30 seconds long.
-   Video must have at least 2 different video sources.
-   Video must have at least 5 cuts

## Rendering your Video

BEFORE RENDERING: Save your project, and ensure that it is properly saved. Sometimes rendering can cause the program to crash and you might lose some or all of your work.

Once you have edited your video and saved your project, you will need to "render" it out to a single file that you can share. To do this, go to File>Export>Media. In the Export Settings window, set the format to "H.264". Once that is set, select the "YouTube 720p HD" preset from the dropdown. After you have set both of those correctly, press the "Export" button.

Exporting should take a few seconds. If it takes more than a minute, something is probably wrong or your video is too long. Let me know if it seems like the program has frozen.

## Submitting Your Work

You will need to upload a page to your GitHub repo at `igme110/video/index.html` that has the following things:

-   A rendered version of your trailer (see above for details on rendering in Premiere).
-   A screenshot of your project timeline in Premiere, to show that you actually did your own edits.
-   A text document explaining your intent / thought process in creating the video (3 sentences or less).
-   Links to all assets used in the video.
